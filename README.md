# Books and articles notes
This repo is an attempt to organize notes and summaries of books and articles I've read.

## The project structure
I am a huge fan of the [Jhonny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) organization method. However, I always try to adapt it to my real needs.

In this repository, I've taxonimized my notes into four categories: articles, technology, literature (a developer shall not live on code alone), and language learning. These categories are entirely arbitrary and may change (and probably will) in the future - but they serve me well atm.

I don't have a habit of keeping notes on articles and non-tech books, but I'm trying to cultivate one.

It would not make much sense to keep notes on literature books the same way I do on tech books and articles imo. I don't want to turn reading, which is something I enjoy a lot, into a chore - so those notes are usually limited to short reviews of the book and passages I found interesting.

Every entry follows the "[c].[y].[m] n" pattern, where:
- _c_ is the category of the entry (article, tech book, lit, etc);
- _y_ and _m_ are, respectively, the year and the month I started reading the book;
- _n_ is the name of the book.

Subcategories may also exist - such as in the case of the categories `03.00. Portuguese` and `03.01. English`, for example.

## Final words
I (try to) keep an updated list of all books I've read on my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118576377-pedro-henrique).
