# Implementing Domain-Driven Design
## Chapter 2 - Domains, subdomains and bounded contexts
A domain refers to the primary business problem or area that a software tries to address, and domain is usually composed of multiple subdomains. 

Take an clothing e-commerce as an example: it may be divided into many subdomains, although their primary domain is just one: selling clothes. Those subdomains might be product catalog, orders, invoicing and shipping - each subdomain has its own specific details, rules and processes.

A model can have different meanings in different subdomains. Consider a Customer model: in the shipping subdomain, a Customer might be represented by their address and contact details; in contrast, the invoicing subdomain might care about their billing information and tax-related details instead.
