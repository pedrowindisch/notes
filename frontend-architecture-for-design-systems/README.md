- **design systems**: a design system is the representation of the visual language of a website. it consists of colors, fonts/typography, and other UI patterns.
- **css methodologies**: set of guidelines for writing css classes, definitions, etc.

there are many different css methodologies. some of them are:

### OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS)
this methodology uses a modular approach to improve code reuse and maintainability. oocss is based on two main principles:
- **separation of structure from skin**:
- **separation of containers and content**:
    location and containers should not be style qualifiers. `#sidebar h3` is not reusable on components outside the `#sidebar` element, but `.list-item` is. when using the oocss approach, we must ensure that styles are not dependent on any containing element.
    
bootstrap is an example of OOCSS applied in practice.
