- **design systems**: a design system is the representation of the visual language of a website. it consists of colors, fonts/typography, and other UI patterns.
- **css methodologies**: set of guidelines for writing css classes, definitions, etc.

# CSS
## CSS methodologies
there are many different css methodologies. some of them are:

#### OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS)
this methodology uses a modular approach to improve code reuse and maintainability. oocss is based on two main principles:
- **separation of structure from skin**:
- **separation of containers and content**:
    location and containers should not be style qualifiers. `#sidebar h3` is not reusable on components outside the `#sidebar` element, but `.list-item` is. when using the oocss approach, we must ensure that styles are not dependent on any containing element.
    
bootstrap is an example of OOCSS applied in practice.

#### SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS)
SMACSS shares a lot of similarities with OOCSS, but it breaks the styling into five specific categories:
- **base**: how the markup would look without extra classes or styling
- **layout**: the regions of the page
- **module**: modular/reusable classes
- **state**: the current state of the element e.g. `selected` for a checkbox
- **theme**: the current selected theme

#### BEM (Block-Element-Modifier)
BEM is a class naming convention that suggests every element to be labeled with classes that defines:
- the **block** the element is contained, that is, its parent
- the **element** itself
- and any **modifier** of the block or the element

blocks and elements are usually divided by double underscores, and modifiers are added after double dashes. BEM can be quite verbose.

```html
<div class="grid">
    <div class="grid__item" />
    <div class="grid__item" />
    <div class="grid__item" />

    <div class="grid__alert--success" />
</div>
```
## things to keep in mind when coding
there are a few principles that can help us develop consistent, maintanable CSS. 

#### SRP (Single-Responsability Principle)
each class should have a single, focused responsability.

```html
<div class="menu">
    <div class="header"></div>
</div>

<div class="post">
    <div class="header"></div>
</div>

<style>
    .header {
        padding: 1rem;
        color: red;
    }
</style>
```

the markup above seems pretty reusable, but what if we wanted to increse the post header padding? we could do the following:

```css
.post .header {
    padding: 1.25rem;
}
```

althought this approach is effective at first, it makes the post header location dependent, which is not ideal. a better approach would be:

```css
.menu__header {
    color: red;
    padding: 1rem;
}

.post__header {
    padding: 1.25rem;
    color: red;
}
```

althought the color property is now duplicated, this approach will make the code more readable and maintanable in the long term.
