# Linear Algebra Done Wrong

## Systems of linear equations
### Echelon form
- All zero rows, that is, rows where all entries are equal to zero, are below all non-zero entries.
- The leading entry of any non-zero row is strictly to the right of the leading entry of the previous row.
    - Consider leading entry as the leftmost non-zero entry.

#### Triangular form
Square matrix with all entries on the main diagonal non-zero, and all entries below or above the main diagonal zeroed.

#### Reduced echelon form matrix
- Must be in echelon form.
- All pivot entries (leading entry) = 1;
- All entries above the pivots = 0.

To get the reduced echelon form from a matrix in echelon form, we work from the bottom to the top; from right to the left.
