# Linear Algebra Done Wrong

## Systems of linear equations
### Linear systems
A linear system can be defined as a collection of _m_ linear equations with _n_ unknown variables. To solve a system is to find all possible _n_-tuples that satisfy all _m_ equations simultaneosly.

A linear system such as

| x  + y       = 1 <br>
| 2x + z       = 1 <br>
| x  + 2y + 2z = -1 <br>

can be rewritten in the augmented matrix form

| 1 1 0 | 1  | <br>
| 2 0 1 | 1  | <br>
| 1 2 2 | -1 | <br>

where

| 1 1 0 | <br>
| 2 0 1 | <br>
| 1 2 2 | <br>

is called the coefficient matrix.

### Echelon form
- All zero rows, that is, rows where all entries are equal to zero, are below all non-zero entries.
- The leading entry of any non-zero row is strictly to the right of the leading entry of the previous row.
    - Consider leading entry as the leftmost non-zero entry.

#### Triangular form
Square matrix with all entries on the main diagonal non-zero, and all entries below or above the main diagonal zeroed.

#### Reduced echelon form matrix
- Must be in echelon form.
- All pivot entries (leading entry) = 1;
- All entries above the pivots = 0.

To get the reduced echelon form from a matrix in echelon form, we work from the bottom to the top; from right to the left.

### Observations
- A system of linear equations has no solutions if a matrix is inconsistent, that is, if a zero row in the reduced matrix corresponds to a non-zero constant term.
